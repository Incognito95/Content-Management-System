# Content Management System
#### Project Description
This is a content management system that I have built using ExpressJS which is a backend framework for Javascript that is connected to a MySQL database. Your able to create your own user and manage the content to allow multiple contributers to create, edit and publish content. The content is stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates like a website.

#### Install and Run the Project
```
run your local server
import .sql file into your database
go into the terminal and type: 
npm install (to install the node_modules folder that contains the packages) 
npm run dev: runs the server
```
